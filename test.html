<h1>Instructions on Using Github on the Command Line</h1>

<h3>Basic Commands for Command line</h3>
<h3>cd &emsp; This command takes you to the home directory</h3>
<p> Using this command with a file directory will take you to the file location. The command below will take you to the location of the folder GitPractice.</p>
<h3>cd Documents/GitHub/GitPractice</h3>

<h3>ls &emsp; This command shows the files that are located in the current directory.</h3>

<p>Always make sure that you are working inside of the directory in which your project is located. <br>
    To bring projects from github.com in the command line type:</p>

<h3>git clone "put url for repository here"</h3>

<h3>Example: </h3>
<h3>git clone "https://github.com/j14chambers/GitPractice.git</h3>

<p>This command adds the all new changes to github</p>
git add .

<p>This command adds the changes made to a specific file.</p>
git add file name

Example:
git add test.html

<p>This command note changes made to files. It serves as a note for others and helps keep track of when and what changes were made</p>
<h3>git commit -m "commit message"</h3>

<p>This command shows the status of the repository. It notes whether you have made changes on the local repository or whether there are changes on the github.com that need to be push to the local repository.</p>

<h3> git status</h3>


<p>This command pushes the changes made on the local repsitory to github.com.</p>
<h3>git push origin master</h3>

<p>This command pulls changes made on github.com</p>

<h3>git pull</h3>

<p>Create a new folder on your computer. Open the command line and direct to that folder. By doing this on the computer, you can create a github repository using this command. Make sure you are in the directory where the project will be created.</p>

<h3>git init</h3>

<p>This command  connects the above folder with a github project.</p>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<h3>git remote origin https://github.com/j14chambers/GitPractice.git</h3>

<p>Do a git pull origin master to pull files from the directory you were working from above.This command will put all files associated with GiPractice into the new folder created.<br>
To make it simple: The file just created acts as another person. The orignal file from github cloned, represents you.</p>

<p> For example: <br>
There is a team of 2 people, working on the same project. One person creates the project on github.com and calls it Project1. That person make a clone of that project and starts making changes to the files. That person then pushes the changes to github.com. The second person comes along and makes a local directory on their computer called Testfiles. That person wants to know if there are changes to the project that they are working and does a git remote origin to link their local directory to github. The second person does a pull for Project1 and now have those files on their local repository. The second person only made minor changes to the file and does a push to the master branch in Project1. So now the changes that the second person made are now on github.com and the first person can see those changes.</p>
